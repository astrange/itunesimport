Given a folder with an album, it fixes up tags and adds it to iTunes.

=====================
Working
=====================
- Reads wav/cue and other audio formats supported by QuickTime.
- Universal charset detection for ID3 tags and cuesheets.
- Supports "album artist" vs "artist", fixes track numbers, that kind of thing.

=====================
Not working
=====================
- Needs an option to guess tags from file names.
- Needs an option to manually choose the charset (which is frequently misguessed)
- taglib is too opaque when we want raw bytes; ditch it for libavformat or something.
- It can't reencode an album with individual tracks.
- Can't import album art, because iTunes' API is broken.
- Can't delete temporary WAV files in the library for some reason.
- The program has to be restarted after it's done.
- No progress information.
